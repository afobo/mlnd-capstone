    "\n",
    "### Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "I work for the software development company, and we pay high attention to the test automation.\n",
    "During 15 years of our product development and many implemented customer projects we accumulated a lot of autotests.\n",
    "Autotests check various parts of our product in different environments, e.g. \n",
    "\n",
    "- 1, 2, 4, 8 VM clusters\n",
    "- RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) version 6 or 7\n",
    "- different versions of Java (our primary programming language)\n",
    "- etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "Individual test's execution times vary from few minutes to several hours depending on complexity and size.\n",
    "\n",
    "We built the private cloud (based on Openstack) for the continuous autotest execution and a simple Web interface to manage it.\n",
    "On the dedicated page test engineer or developer may choose the list of tests he want to execute, number of virtual machines, versions of the 3rdparty software to be provisioned in the VMs, and so on.\n",
    "After that the execution request is queued to be executed as soon as possible according to cloud capacity and current VM consumption.\n",
    "As a result, engineer receives an email with the test report.\n",
    "Test reports are also stored in some shared directory for reference, comparison and further analysis needs.     \n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "For the higher cloud capacity utilization and better user experience we would like to have a model capable to predict overall test execution time.\n",
    "This time is a sum of three:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Queue time (t1)**: time spent by an execution request in the queue waiting for the free cloud capacity\n",
    "- **VM preparation time (t2)**: time to create a cluster of VMs and provision it with the requested 3rdparty software\n",
    "- **Actual test execution time (t3)**: actual test execution till the final report   \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I would focus on t2 estimation only, leaving t1 and t3 for a future.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the brief workflow to prepare the solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clean up data: remove records about failed cluster creations\n",
    "- Prepare benchmark model for final solution evaluation\n",
    "- Remove useless features - e.g. success/failure indicator, number of attempts performed\n",
    "- Transform original features\n",
    "- Try various regression models provided by scikit-learn\n",
    "- Tune the best model with grid search cross-validation\n",
    "- Test final model on a testing set, compare with the benchmark model. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "[R^2 regression score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination) (coefficient of determination) would be used as the main evaluation metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, [MAE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_error) (mean absolute error) and [RMSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation) (root mean squared error) would be used for illustrative purposes."

    "- `attempts`: Number of attempts performed to create and provision requested cluster, can be from `1` to `10`. The procedure gives up if a cluster is still failed after 10 subsequent attempts to build it\n",
    "- `start_ts`: Start timestamp (in milliseconds from 1970, Jan, 1, 00:00:00 UTC)\n",
    "- `end_ts`: End timestamp (in milliseconds from 1970, Jan, 1, 00:00:00 UTC)\n",
    "- `failed`: Was it finished successfully or not?\n",
    "- `completed`: Was it completed (even with failure) or interrupted?\n",
    "- `vm_count`: Number of requested virtual machines in the cluster, can be from `1` to `26`\n",
    "- `build_name`: Some unique version identifier in our build system\n",

    "- `with_image`: Custom base VM image to be used, or `_default_` if some prepared RHEL image is sufficient\n",

    "In this section, you will need to provide discussion as to how one aspect of the implementation you designed could be improved. As an example, consider ways your implementation can be made more general, and what would need to be modified. You do not need to make this improvement, but the potential solutions resulting from these changes are considered and compared/contrasted to your current solution. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "- _Are there further improvements that could be made on the algorithms or techniques you used in this project?_\n",
